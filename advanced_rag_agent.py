1.  **General Question**: If the question is a general greeting (e.g., "hello", "how are you?"), a question about you ("who are you?"), or simple off-topic chit-chat, classify it as a general question.
2.  **Tool-requiring Question**: If the question is about DuoLife products, ingredients, business model, or health, it requires tools.

For tool-requiring questions, you must also determine if it needs a specific graph search for:
- The ingredients of a specific product.
- A list of products that contain a specific ingredient.
- Links to specific products.

All other questions about DuoLife will use a vector search.
